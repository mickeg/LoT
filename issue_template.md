Hi! Thank you for reporting an issue. A few things first:

##### Potential bugs or issues
* Check that you have (only) the latest version installed and any cache is cleared from the browser. 
You may also have to recreate the object in Qlik Sense with the new version of the extension.

* Describe the problem in as much detail as possible. (We will not respond to generic issues such as "the extension does not work".)

* Include examples, screen shots and any errors you get in the browser console.

##### General feedback and feature proposals
We are happy to hear what you think about the extensions and how they can be improved. 
As long it's relevant, useful and in line with this extensions purpose we are open for ideas and suggestions.
